## Render HTML to PDF

AWS produces monthly and weekly reports to run the business. In an attempt to make these reports available for each business unit, adapted versions of the same report content was needed to be produced. This meant that one of the teams had to produce 37 reports each week. With the goal to reduce operational inefficiencies for AWS, I built a distributable and scalable weekly report production Python software that minimised their monthly forecast variation from 10% to 3%, boosted pipeline cover from 0.2x to 4.5x, and repurposed 95% of managers' time to more productive work.

This repository consists of the assets that are used alongside my medium article (link [here](https://medium.com/p/1780783607f)) to educate viewers on how to generate PDF reports with python and HTML.
